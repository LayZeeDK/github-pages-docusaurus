# Configure Wallets

This guide help you connect your wallet to MXC (Wannsee testnet). There are two networks to configure your wallet with:  
**Arbiturm (goerli testnet)** and **MXC(Wannsee testnet)**

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

### 1. Add the Arbitrum Goerli testnet
Visit [https://chainid.network/](https://chainid.network/), search for "Arbitrum Goerli", and click the "Add Chain" button.

### 2. Add the MXC Wannsee testnet
Visit [https://chainid.network/](https://chainid.network/), search for "MXC Wannsee", and click the "Add Chain" button.

### 3. Add MXC, Ride, Park tokens to your wallet
Use your wallet (e.g., Metamask) and [import the tokens](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6375103346077-Add-custom-tokens-to-MetaMask?docs=true) with [this configuration](/docs/Resources/Address#erc-20-token-contracts).

## Troubleshooting
### The add chain buttons did not work
Try to manually add the network to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/Resources/RPC).
