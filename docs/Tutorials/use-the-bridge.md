This guide will help you use the bridge to send tokens between Arbitrum Goerli and MXC (Wannsee testnet). You can read more about how bridging works [here](/docs/Designs/Bridge). 

> The Ride token and Park token are both dummy test tokens that are used for testing the bridge and swap.

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Arbitrum Goerli and/or MXC Wannsee (you can [receive tokens here](/docs/Tutorials/receive-tokens)).

## Steps 

### Visit the bridge
Visit the [bridge](https://wannsee-bridge.mxc.com/) and the UI should be intuitive.

### Bridge tokens from Arbitrum Goerli to MXC Wannsee
